TODO write down Oura sleep data/screenshots.
Did not have any food/calories.
Measured weight - 75.9kg.
Did not drink anything, started hydrating from the drinking bottle before warmup, during warmup and during stages.

# At the manege

- connect Awair to USB-C cable with the USB-A end plugged in to non-fast charging port of power bank
- place the Awair on the ground, 1 meter from the running track
- place the 4 blank paper sheets on the sides of the track, in the middle of the straights
- TODO layout of other things

# Protocol

TODO

# Things to do differently next time

* Do not squeeze when taking a sample, the blood has to flow freely - "It does not matter if you use the ear lobe or the finger as long as you do a technique that does not involve squeezing the blood out." - https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts330/

# Open questions

* how to hydrate?
