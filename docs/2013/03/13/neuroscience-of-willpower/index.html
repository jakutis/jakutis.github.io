<ul>
  <li>Sleep more and better so that you have more initial willpower for the day.</li>
  <li>Eat food that sustains the energy (sugars do not sustain it) to keep the brain stable, to be more likely able to surf the urge.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="train-your-willpower-physiology">Train your willpower physiology</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The tedious task that you practice does not have to be very important task.</li>
  <li>Meditate by breathing, noticing thoughts wandering and getting back to breathing.</li>
  <li>Do cardiovascular exercise to receive an overall positive effect on making good choices [2].</li>

<h2 id="when-willpower-mistake-happens-forgive-yourself">When willpower mistake happens, forgive yourself</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Notice that youâ€™re feeling bad about the mistake.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more different people think their future self will be, the less willpower they currently have.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Think about your future self, imagine yourself in doing some usual activity (e.g. grocery shopping) or better - write a letter.</li>
  <li>Imagine specific future related to your willpower challenge (imagine what you will say to yourself just before making the willpower mistake) - it is more helpful in boosting willpower by imagining failure and the consequences of it, because we think about what could have caused it and then working prevent it - become the detective of your own failure.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stay put, hold your breath, do nothing when you are in an uncomfortable position (very close to making a willpower mistake)</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the thought, craving or feeling.</li>
  <li>Accept and attend to the inner experience.</li>
  <li>Breathe and give your brain and body a chance to pause and plan.</li>
  <li>Broaden your attention and look for the action that will help you achieve your goal.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do less of the things that take some amount of willpower (e.g. you can skip tidying your room, or taking out garbage) before a task of exceptional importance (e.g. taking an exam).</p>
